      <h2>The Necklace</h2>
      <p><strong>By Guy de Maupassant</strong></p>
      <p>Madame Loisel was a pretty and charming woman, born for luxury, but married to a poor clerk. She longed for beauty, jewels, and gowns she could never afford.</p>

      <p>At the ball, she was admired by all, but when she returned home, she discovered the necklace was gone. In desperation, she and her husband bought a replacement, plunging them into ten years of exhausting labor to repay the debt.</p>
      <p>At last, worn and aged, Madame Loisel met Madame Forestier again‚Äîonly to learn the necklace she had lost was fake, worth nothing.</p>

      <p>The police investigate, unaware that the murder weapon is cooking in the oven. When they grow hungry, Mary kindly offers them the roast.</p>
      <p>As they eat, one detective jokes that the weapon is ‚Äúprobably right under our noses.‚Äù Mary smiles, knowing they are literally devouring the evidence.</p>
